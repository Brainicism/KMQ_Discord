# Privacy Policy

KMQ takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy we provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.


## Collection of Routine Information

In order for KMQ's core functionality to work, we require Discord to send us the message content on every server we are on. In order to provide command functionality, KMQ will parse your message to see if it begins with a prefix, and check if the command is valid. In order to provide 'guessing' functionality, KMQ will parse your message contents to see if it matches with the correct answer. In this specific case, KMQ will only parse message contents if there is an active game session in the text channel. 

KMQ may also collect and log basic unique identifiers to perform basic functionality. These include your Discord User ID, and each server's Discord Guild ID. None of this information can be used to personally identify a specific user on KMQ. Users are able to opt-in to having their Discord tag visible on a global leaderboard, but this is optional and can be opted-out. 

The entirety of your message contents are never saved, or logged in a way such that the creators or other actors are able to read. 

### Information Usage
- Discord User ID
    - used to record user statistics, such as: games played, songs guessed, badges, bookmarked songs
- Discord Guild ID
    - used to maintain guild related settings, such as: game options, game option presets, guild gameplay statistics, game session statistics
- Discord Tag
    - used to display usernames on the global leaderboard. This is an opt-in feature with ability to opt-out


## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. Although we do not store any PII, we can assure you that we take every precaution necessary to prevent unwanted data accesses. Discord message API objects (which may contain PII) are never written to disk or logged in their entirety and only processed in memory. Any information specified in the previous section is stored on a secure database with proper access controls, on a file system that is encrypted at rest. Any applications accessing KMQ's server transmits data over TLS/SSL, encrypting the data in transit. Password-based SSH authentication is disabled on the server.

## Opting Out
Upon request, users may request that all of their current and future information be deleted from KMQ. 

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 10/25/21 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically.
