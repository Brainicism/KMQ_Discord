## Aliases
`data/artist_aliases.json` is used to alias artist names for one of two purposes: accepting parent groups of subunits as correct guesses for `,mode artist/both` ("guessAliases"), and alternate commonly used names for group name matching for `,groups` ("matchAliases").

This alias file is automatically reloaded every 5 minutes.
