# Gameplay

Gameplay is initiated via `/play`, which invites the bot to a voice channel. The bot will begin to play a random kpop song based on the game options. Users can guess the song by simply typing their guess. [A more detailed gameplay guide as well as the full list of commands can be found here](https://brainicism.github.io/KMQ_Discord/GAMEPLAY).
