# Gameplay
Gameplay is initiated via `,play`, which invites the bot to a voice channel. The bot will begin to play a random kpop song based on the game options. Users can guess the song by simply typing their guess. [A more detailed gameplay guide as well as the full list of commands can be found here](docs/GAMEPLAY.md).
